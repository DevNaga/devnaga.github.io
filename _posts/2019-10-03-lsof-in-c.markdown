sometimes, it is necessary to know all the files that are currently in use by a process / or by a specific list of processes.

Situation arises to not touch those files / write / delete them at any point and wait till some action is complete on the files.

so, there is a command `lsof` which knows all the opened files by a current process. So how does it do ? well, reading the `/proc/pid/fd`.

the proc file system exposes various information about a process that is currently running in the system. It also contains the number of opened files currently by a process.

lets' say that the current program is `bash`. On my host computer, 

```bash
dev@dev-MacBookPro:~/oslab/edge_sdk$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 1331 pts/0    00:00:08 bash
20728 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

The `bash` has pid of 1331. Doing `ls -l /proc/1331/fd` reveals the following information.


```bash
dev@dev-MacBookPro:~/oslab/edge_sdk$ ls -l /proc/1331/fd/
total 0
lrwx------ 1 dev dev 64 Mar 21 08:10 0 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 dev dev 64 Mar 21 08:10 1 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 dev dev 64 Mar 21 08:10 2 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 dev dev 64 Mar 21 08:10 255 -> /dev/pts/0
```

the file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 points to the `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` respectively. The command `ls -l` reads through the symlink and details the full file name.

So, how do we do programmatically ?

We need to do the following,

1. open directory (aka, `opendir`) /proc/pid/fd. pid must be known.
2. read directory (aka, `readdir`), skip all the `.` and `..` directories.
3. perform `readlink` call on each file name that's read.
4. check if its not a directory, and store / print the contents.


Below is an example:
